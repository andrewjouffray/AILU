- use configure or something similar to check for libraries and which compiler to use and flags

- use 1000 color range for ColorDefinition, this is usueful for smoother gradients

- add more visualizers
    - add beat detection
    - add flashing squares
    - rotating boxes
    - revolving lines
        - color lines based on volume
        - maybe use ellipse like transformer to generate lines
            - lines would go from either end of the equivalent ellipse and revolve towards whatever the next position is

- add more color examples
    - add gifs of gradients

- colors scheme improvements
    - allow assigning different color schemes to different visualizers

- add windows support
    - probably just ncurses through cygwin
    - audio source would be some windows api
    - use define guards everywhere there are *nix dependent includes
